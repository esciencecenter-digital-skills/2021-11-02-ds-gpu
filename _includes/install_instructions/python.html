Remove the third paragraph if the workshop will teach Python
using something other than the Jupyter Notebook. Details at

  <h3>Programming environment</h3>

  <p>
    We will teach GPU programming using the <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>,
    a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
    up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
    Firefox browsers are all
    <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#browser-compatibility">supported</a>
    (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
    and below, are not).
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, for this workshop we are using the infrastructure of <a href="https://servicedesk.surfsara.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/JupyterHub+for+education">JupyterHub for Education</a> provided by <a href="https://www.surf.nl/">Surf</a>, or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a> as an alternative.
